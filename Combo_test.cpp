     * TODO: See if you can create an SDA and use its output to create a graph.
     *
     * Consider a graph that is stored in an upper-triangular adjacency matrix
     * That means if a graph has 4 nodes: A, B, C, and D with the following connections
     * A <-> B
     * B <-> C
     * B <-> D
     * Then the matrix would look like this:
     * 0 1 0 0
     * 0 0 1 1
     * 0 0 0 0
     * 0 0 0 0
     *
     * In general, a graph with N nodes needs N*(N-1)/2 weights to store all the possible edges.
